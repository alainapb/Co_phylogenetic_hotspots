# Co_phylogenetic_hotspots


Abstract: 
The incidence of zoonotic diseases is increasing worldwide, which makes identifying parasites likely to become zoonotic and hosts likely to harbor zoonotic parasites a critical concern. Prior work indicates that there is a higher risk of zoonotic spillover from hosts that are infected with a high phylogenetic diversity of parasites, especially if those parasites can infect a high phylogenetic diversity of hosts, which we term a co-phylogenetic hotspot for zoonotic disease. Thus, predicting co-phylogenetic hotspots requires combining data on host-parasite associations with host and parasite phylogenies. Here we use a host-parasite database containing associations between 249 helminth species and 190 wild mammals in combination with phylogenetic models to identify (1) co-phylogenetic hotspots, (2) high quality hosts that harbor a diverse set of specialist parasites, (3) niche partitioning between parasites (overlapping but not intersecting phylogenetic host ranges), and (4) cases of tight pairwise coevolution. We find evidence for all four types of associations within our dataset. In particular, we find that New World monkeys and their parasites form a co-phylogenetic hotspot; their phylogenetic closeness to humans makes them an especially important potential source for zoonoses. More broadly, we suggest that co-phylogenetic analyses can provide a novel perspective on emerging infectious disease.
