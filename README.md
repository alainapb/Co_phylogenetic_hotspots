This project contains the code for: Pfenning-Butterworth AC, Davies TJ, and Cressler CE. Identifying co-phylogenetic hotspots for zoonotic disease. In Phil Trans B issue on ‘Infectious disease macroecology: parasite diversity and dynamics across the globe’

Here, we use host–parasite datasets containing associations between helminth taxa and free-range mammals in combination with phylogenetic models to explore whether host,parasite, or both host and parasite evolutionary history influences host–parasite associations.
